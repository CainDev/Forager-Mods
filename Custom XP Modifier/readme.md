# Simple Overlay Mod
This is a very basic XP Modifier that works on Gathering Resources (Trees, Rocks, Ores).

## Quick-Help:
Command: /xpmodify (1-25)

This will multiply the XP you gain by whatever you want.

Known Bugs
- Typing anything but a number in the command will crash the game.
- Sometimes multiplies infinite amount and infinite gets you level 65.
